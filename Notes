HTML Notes
Introduction to HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It defines the structure of a webpage using various elements and tags. HTML documents are made up of a series of elements that describe the content and structure of the page.

1. Basic Structure of an HTML Document
Every HTML document has a basic structure that consists of the following:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
<html>: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.
<head>: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets or scripts.
<body>: Contains the content of the webpage, which is visible to users.
2. HTML Elements and Tags
HTML is built using elements, which consist of:

Opening Tag: Indicates the start of an element (e.g., <p>).
Content: The text or elements contained within the tags.
Closing Tag: Indicates the end of an element (e.g., </p>).
Example of an HTML Element
html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
3. Common HTML Tags
3.1 Headings
Headings are defined using <h1> to <h6> tags, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> the lowest.

html
Copy code
<h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
<h3>This is a heading 3</h3>
3.2 Paragraphs
The <p> tag is used to define paragraphs.

html
Copy code
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
3.3 Links
Links are created using the <a> (anchor) tag, with the href attribute specifying the URL.

html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
3.4 Images
Images are embedded using the <img> tag, with the src attribute pointing to the image location.

html
Copy code
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image" width="300" height="200">
3.5 Lists
HTML supports two types of lists:

Unordered Lists: Created with the <ul> tag, using <li> for list items.
html
Copy code
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
Ordered Lists: Created with the <ol> tag.
html
Copy code
<ol>
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
</ol>
4. Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs.

Example of Attributes
html
Copy code
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>
href: Specifies the URL of the link.
target: Specifies where to open the linked document (e.g., _blank opens in a new tab).
5. Multimedia Elements
HTML allows for the inclusion of multimedia elements such as audio and video.

5.1 Audio
To include audio, use the <audio> tag with the controls attribute to display playback controls.

html
Copy code
<audio controls>
    <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
5.2 Video
For video content, use the <video> tag.

html
Copy code
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
    <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
6. Tables
Tables are created using the <table> tag, with <tr> for rows, <th> for headers, and <td> for data cells.

html
Copy code
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>John</td>
        <td>30</td>
    </tr>
</table>
7. Forms
Forms are used to collect user input and are defined using the <form> tag. Key elements include:

Input Fields: Various types of input fields can be created using the <input> tag.
html
Copy code
<form action="/submit" method="post">
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
8. Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML uses HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning to both the browser and the developer. This improves accessibility and SEO.

Common semantic elements include:

<header>: Represents introductory content or navigational links.
<nav>: Defines a set of navigation links.
<article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content.
<footer>: Represents footer content.
9. HTML Entities
HTML entities are special characters that can be displayed in HTML code. For example:

&lt; for <
&gt; for >
&amp; for &
10. HTML5 Features
HTML5 introduced several new features and improvements:

Audio and Video: Native support for multimedia elements without requiring plugins.
Canvas: The <canvas> element allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.
Local Storage: Web storage for storing data on the client side.
Geolocation: Access to the geographical location of the user.
11. Best Practices
Use Semantic Elements: Always prefer semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO.
Validate HTML: Use validators to check for errors in your HTML code.
Use Comments: Document your code with comments for better understanding.
